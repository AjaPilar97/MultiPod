		<div class="text"><p>I think people are confused when they look at me. The first thing they wanna ask is: "What are you?" ... But I overall feel like it's an advantage. In this day and age everybody's trying to stand out or be original. I'm lucky to be able to just be like "I'm just me," and that speaks for itself. I'm an alien.</p>

	<div class="overlays">
		<div class="texts"><p>I identify as white because that's just how I grew up. I've always felt really disconnected from my roots. I'm proud of who I am and where I come from, but at the same time because my skin is white, and I look white, I don't realy feel like I have the right to claim that I'm black.</p> </div>

	<div class="overlay2">
		<div class="text2"><p>The white kids think you're one race and the people that you're mixed with think you're too white, ya know? Which is the tale of me. I was mainly exposed to Filipino culture through the food my grandma would make me. But she wanted my dad to have a fully American life... He married my mom, who's white, so I grew up in a white household.</p></div>

		<div class="texts2"><p>In a household that wasn't a very normative household I grew to appreciate different types of people and stories and where people come from especially class wise. Being half white affected how I saw my own privilege. I grew up understanding it in a different way.</p></div>
