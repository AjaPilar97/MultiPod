		<p class="intro">My senior capstone is focusing on the complex experiences of young multiracial women. Iâ€™m going to be exploring the ways in which being mixed race is unique, confusing and sometimes gratifying in a society where the conversation about race is still so fragile. I myself am half-black and half-white, and have dealt with a plethora of distinct situations where my being mixed changed how people talked to me, felt about me or understood me, so I feel this gives me the agency to investigate this topic.</p>
